	<H1> Prehistoric era </H1>
	<P Align = "Justify">Earth’s beginnings can be traced back 4.5 billion years, but human evolution only counts for a tiny speck of its history.
	 The Prehistoric Period—or when there was human life before records documented human activity—roughly dates from 2.5 million years ago to 1,200
	  B.C. It is generally categorized in three archaeological periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age.
	</P>
	<P Align = "Justify">From the invention of tools made for hunting to advances in food production and agriculture to early examples of art and
	 religion, this enormous time span—ending roughly 3,200 years ago (dates vary upon region)—was a period of great transformation.
	</P>
         <H2> Stone age</H2>
	<P Align = "Justify">Divided into three periods: Paleolithic (or Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (or Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (or New Stone
	 Age), this era is marked by the use of tools by our early human ancestors (who evolved around 300,000 B.C.) and the eventual transformation 
	from a culture of hunting and gathering to farming and food production.
	</P>
	<H2> Bronze age </H2>
	<P Align = "Justify">During the Bronze Age (about 3,000 B.C. to 1,300 B.C.), metalworking advances were made, as bronze, a copper and tin alloy
	, was discovered. Now used for weapons and tools, the harder metal replaced its stone predecessors, and helped spark innovations including the
 	ox-drawn plow and the wheel.
	</P>
	<P Align = "Justify">This time period also brought advances in architecture and art, including the invention of the potter’s wheel, and 
	textiles—clothing consisted of mostly wool items such as skirts, kilts, tunics and cloaks. Home dwellings morphed to so-called roundhouses, 
	consisting of a circular stone wall with a thatched or turf roof, complete with a fireplace or hearth, and more villages and cities began to form.
	</P>
	<H2> Iron age </H2>
	<P Align = "Justify">The discovery of ways to heat and forge iron kicked off the Iron Age (roughly 1,300 B.C. to 900 B.C.). At the time, metal was
 	seen as more precious than gold, and wrought iron (which would be replaced by steel with the advent of smelting iron) was easier to manufacture than bronze.
	</P>
	<P Align = "Justify">
	Along with mass production of iron tools and weapons, the age saw even further advances in architecture, with four-room homes, some complete with stables for
 	animals, joining more rudimentary hill forts, as well as royal palaces, temples and other religious structures. Early city planning also took place, with
 	blocks of homes being erected along paved or cobblestone streets and water systems put into place.
